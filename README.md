 The "Chidiya" project is a web-based platform built using Flask and MySQL, designed to facilitate user interactions around shared topics. It allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles with profile pictures. Users can create, view, and comment on topics within a structured dashboard, which displays user-generated content. The project emphasizes user engagement through replies and feedback, with a responsive design achieved using separate CSS files for each HTML page. The platform also includes a search feature for topics, providing live suggestions as users type.
